                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>Video games have been a significant part of many people's lives, providing endless hours of
                    entertainment and a chance to escape reality. In this text, we explore how personal preference plays
                    a significant role in the games we choose to play and love. For me, my favorite games include Slay
                    the Spire, Rainbow Six Siege, and GTA San Andreas. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss how
                    strategic gameplay, tactical shooters, nostalgia, and replayability have influenced my love for
                    these games. Whether it's the challenge of strategic thinking, the thrill of teamwork in a tactical
                    shooter, the nostalgia of exploring an open world, or the joy of reliving favorite moments, these
                    games have something special to offer.</p>
                <h3>Strategic Gameplay</h3>
                <p><a href="favoriteGames.html">Slay the Spire</a> has become one of my favorite games because of its
                    strategic
                    gameplay. Every game is
                    different and requires me to think creatively to defeat the enemies and ascend the tower. The
                    game's
                    deck-building mechanics are intuitive and fun, and the variety of cards available makes each run
                    feel unique. I love how the game balances risk and reward, and how even a small mistake can have
                    dire consequences. The game's engaging gameplay has kept me coming back for more, and I can't
                    wait
                    to see what new challenges the developers will add in the future.</p>
                <h3>Tactical Shooters</h3>
                <p>Rainbow Six Siege is another game that has won me over with its tactical gameplay. The game's focus
                    on team-based strategies and communication sets it apart from other shooters. I enjoy the variety of
                    operators and their unique gadgets, which allow for endless combinations of strategies. The
                    destructible environments add an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, as players can create new
                    angles and pathways to outmaneuver their opponents. The game's emphasis on skill and coordination
                    has kept me engaged for years, and I look forward to seeing how the game will continue to evolve.
                </p>
                <h3>Nostalgia and Open-World Exploration</h3>
                <p>GTA San Andreas is a classic game that holds a special place in my heart. The game's open-world
                    environment and variety of activities made it an instant favorite for me. I loved exploring the
                    game's vast map and discovering all the secrets it held. The game's storyline was engaging and full
                    of memorable characters, and the ability to customize my character with different clothes and
                    vehicles was a fun bonus. But what I love most about GTA San Andreas is the nostalgia it brings me.
                    Playing the game today brings back memories of my childhood and the countless hours I spent playing
                    with friends.</p>
                <h3>Replaying and Nostalgia</h3>
                <p>All three of my favorite games have something in common: they all have replayability and nostalgia.
                    Even after completing a game, I find myself wanting to play it again and try out new strategies. The
                    nostalgia factor also plays a big role, as these games bring back fond memories of times spent with
                    friends or just enjoying the game on my own. The feeling of being able to relive those moments
                    through playing the games again is what makes them so special to me. In the end, my favorite games
                    are the ones that not only provide great gameplay, but also leave a lasting impression that keeps me
                    coming back for more.</p>
