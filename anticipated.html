                <p class="upDesc" style="float:left">Dark and Darker is an upcoming first-person fantasy dungeon
                    adventure game that aims
                    to capture the
                    wonder and awe of classic fantasy adventure games. The game is set in an ancient citadel where
                    players must band together with friends and use their courage, wits, and cunning to uncover mythical
                    treasures and defeat gruesome monsters. The game is unforgivingly hardcore, and even the smallest
                    misstep can result in death and the loss of all your loot. The focus is on first-person combat, and
                    players must use their eyes and ears to survive in this harsh world. Magic is a powerful but
                    unwieldy force that requires special skills and equipment to master. The darkness is your friend,
                    and blending into it can lead to a stealthy retreat. The ultimate goal is to discover hidden portals
                    to uncover the most hideous monsters and invaluable artifacts and find a rare exit before the
                    darkness reclaims your riches and your corpse.</p>

                    Entertainment and published by Sega for Windows. A sequel to Company of Heroes 2, the game features
                    new mechanics and modes and is set in the Italian and North African theaters of World War II. The
                    game has features new to the series such as the Tactical Pause system, which allows the player to
                    pause a battle and queue up commands to be done after the game is resumed.[3][4] Company of Heroes 3
                    also has an improved destruction system that gives the title more granular destruction, such as
                    individual tiles and bricks crumbling off buildings.[5] Italian Partisans are allied NPCs that can
                    either be used on the map or be called in during battles.[6] The story is dynamic, and the player's
                    interactions with the game's various commanders can affect the narrative's ending.</p>
